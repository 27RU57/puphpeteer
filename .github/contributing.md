## Provide logs with your bug report

Bug reports should contain logs generated by your reproducible example. To get them you must provide a logger to your PuPHPeteer instance. Say you have the following code in your bug report:

```php
use Nesk\Puphpeteer\Puppeteer;

$puppeteer = new Puppeteer;
$browser = $puppeteer->launch();
$browser->newPage()->goto('https://example.com');
$browser->close();
```

Require Monolog with Composer:

```shell
composer require monolog/monolog
```

And provide a Monolog instance to the `Puppeteer` constructor:

```diff
  use Nesk\Puphpeteer\Puppeteer;

- $puppeteer = new Puppeteer;
+ $logPath = 'path/to/your.log';
+ 
+ $logger = new \Monolog\Logger('PuPHPeteer');
+ $logger->pushHandler(new \Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler($logPath, \Monolog\Logger::DEBUG));
+ 
+ $puppeteer = new Puppeteer(['logger' => $logger]);
  $browser = $puppeteer->launch();
  $browser->newPage()->goto('https://example.com');
  $browser->close();
```

Execute your code and `path/to/your.log` will contain the generated logs, here's an example of what you can get and provide in your bug report:

```
